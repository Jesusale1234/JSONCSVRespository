In this repository, we can see the following:

Sprint 3.
  - A method that allows the conversion of JSON files to CSV files.

Sprint 2.
  - Use of libraries related to JSON and CSV files
  - Creation of JSON and CSV files
  - Reading of JSON and CSV files

Important aspects of the project
  - JsontoCSV package: Allows the conversion of JSON files to CSV files.
  - pom.xml file: Shows dependencies used for the work.
  - JsonSimple package: Allows the creation, writing, and reading of JSON files.
  - CSVfile package: Allows the creation, writing, and reading of CSV files.

Instructions:
  1. Download the project.
  2. Open the project in an IDE that supports Java.
  3. Open the WRITING (ReadCSV or Read) file of the CSVfile or JsonSimple package and execute it, so the files are created and written.
  4. Open the READING (WriteCSV or WriteJSON) file of the CSVfile or JsonSimple package and execute it to read it in the console.
  5. Do steps 3 and 4 with the other package to verify the correct functionality.
  6. Open the JsontoCSV package and execute it. It will take the previously created uniapp.json as the reference JSON file, and it will convert it to a CSV file with the "uniapp_students.csv" name.
  7. Check the filepath of the generated file to verify the correct writing of the file.
